## 🔬 Project Overview

This an end-to-end data engineering project, where I created an ELT data pipeline to extract, analyze, and visualize insights from the data of a 
retail store.


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Set up the cloud infrastructure using Terraform.
- Set up your Airflow local environment with the Astro CLI.
- Create a data pipeline from scratch using Apache Airflow.
- Upload CSV files into Google Cloud Storage.
- Ingest data into BigQuery.
- Implement data quality checks in the pipeline using Soda.
- Integrate dbt and run data models with Airflow and Cosmos.
- Visualize insights using Looker Studio.


## 🕵️ Key Insights

- 💸 **Total Revenue by Country**
- 🎁 **Top 3 sold products**
- 📈 **Revenue by months**

  
## 📝 Project Architecture

The end-to-end data pipeline includes the following steps:

- Setting up the infrastructure on GCP *(Terraform)*
- Downloading, processing, and uploading the initial dataset to a Data Lake *(GCP Storage Bucket)*
- Moving the data from the lake to a Data Warehouse *(GCP BigQuery)*
- Transforming the data in the Data Warehouse and preparing it for the dashboard *(dbt)*
- Checking the quality of the data in the Data Warehouse *(Soda)*
- Creating the dashboard *(Looker Studio)*
 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Infrastructure**: Terraform
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- Data Lake (DL): Cloud Storage
- Data Warehouse (DWH): BigQuery
- **Astro SDK** for Airflow
- **Workflow orchestration:** Apache Airflow
- **Transforming data:** dbt (Data Build Tool)
- **Data quality checks:** Soda
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Data Visualization:** Looker Studio
